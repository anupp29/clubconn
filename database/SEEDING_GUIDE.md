# ClubConn Database Seeding Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for seeding the ClubConn database with perfect, normalized data that matches the frontend context.

## Prerequisites
- MySQL 8.0 or higher installed
- MySQL command-line client or MySQL Workbench
- Database user with CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT privileges

## Seeding Steps

### 1. Create Database and Schema

\`\`\`bash
# Navigate to the database directory
cd database/mysql

# Run schema creation
mysql -u root -p < 01_schema.sql
\`\`\`

This will:
- Drop existing `clubconn` database (if exists)
- Create new `clubconn` database
- Create all tables with proper constraints
- Set up indexes for performance
- Establish foreign key relationships

### 2. Seed Sample Data

\`\`\`bash
# Run seed data script
mysql -u root -p < 07_sample_data.sql
\`\`\`

This will insert:
- 3 colleges (KKWIEER, Sandip, MITAOE)
- 6 communities (Tech, Cultural, Sports, Business, Social Service, Creative Arts)
- 14 users (13 students + 1 admin)
- 6 clubs (CSI, FOSS, Debuggers, DESOC, Phoenix, MIBCS)
- 17 club memberships
- 14 events across all clubs
- 20+ event RSVPs
- 8 certificates
- 18 badges
- 13 user badge achievements
- 14 activity feed entries
- 7 volunteers
- 7 sponsors
- 5 proposals
- 8 feedback entries
- 12 points history records
- 5 sponsorship packages
- System settings

### 3. Verify Seeding

\`\`\`bash
# Run verification script
mysql -u root -p < 08_verification.sql
\`\`\`

This will check:
- ✓ Data count verification (all expected records inserted)
- ✓ Foreign key integrity (no orphaned records)
- ✓ Data consistency (all relationships valid)
- ✓ Business logic validation (dates, counts, etc.)
- ✓ Sample data queries (clubs, events, users)
- ✓ Final summary with database statistics

### Expected Output

\`\`\`

Volunteers          | 7     | 7        | ✓ PASS
Sponsors            | 7     | 7        | ✓ PASS
Proposals           | 5     | 5        | ✓ PASS
Event Feedback      | 8     | 8        | ✓ PASS
Points History      | 12    | 12       | ✓ PASS

========== FOREIGN KEY INTEGRITY CHECK ==========
Check_Type                  | Count | Status
----------------------------|-------|--------
Orphaned Club Members       | 0     | ✓ PASS
Orphaned Events             | 0     | ✓ PASS
Orphaned RSVPs              | 0     | ✓ PASS
Orphaned Certificates       | 0     | ✓ PASS

========== VERIFICATION COMPLETE ==========
Result: If all checks show ✓ PASS, the database is properly seeded!

## Quick Verification Commands

### Check Total Records
\`\`\`sql
USE clubconn;

SELECT 'Colleges' as entity, COUNT(*) as count FROM colleges
UNION ALL SELECT 'Communities', COUNT(*) FROM communities
UNION ALL SELECT 'Users', COUNT(*) FROM users
UNION ALL SELECT 'Clubs', COUNT(*) FROM clubs
UNION ALL SELECT 'Events', COUNT(*) FROM events;
\`\`\`

### Check Sample Data
\`\`\`sql
-- View all clubs with their communities
SELECT c.club_name, com.community_name, c.member_count
FROM clubs c
JOIN communities com ON c.community_id = com.community_id;

-- View upcoming events
SELECT e.event_name, c.club_name, e.start_date, e.status
FROM events e
JOIN clubs c ON e.club_id = c.club_id
WHERE e.start_date > NOW()
ORDER BY e.start_date;

-- View top users by points
SELECT username, full_name, total_points
FROM users
WHERE user_type IN ('student', 'club_admin')
ORDER BY total_points DESC
LIMIT 10;
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Table doesn't exist
**Solution:** Run the schema creation script first (01_schema.sql)

### Error: Unknown column
**Solution:** Ensure you're using the latest schema file. The seed data matches the schema exactly.

### Error: Duplicate entry
**Solution:** The seed script includes `TRUNCATE` commands. If you get duplicates, manually truncate tables or drop and recreate the database.

### Error: Foreign key constraint fails
**Solution:** The seed script disables foreign key checks temporarily. Ensure you're running the complete script, not partial sections.

## Data Normalization

The seed data follows **3NF (Third Normal Form)** and **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**:

### 1NF (First Normal Form)
- ✓ All columns contain atomic values
- ✓ No repeating groups
- ✓ Each column has a unique name
- ✓ Order of rows doesn't matter

### 2NF (Second Normal Form)
- ✓ Meets 1NF requirements
- ✓ No partial dependencies
- ✓ All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key

### 3NF (Third Normal Form)
- ✓ Meets 2NF requirements
- ✓ No transitive dependencies
- ✓ All non-key attributes depend only on the primary key

### BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)
- ✓ Meets 3NF requirements
- ✓ Every determinant is a candidate key
- ✓ No anomalies in functional dependencies

## DBMS Concepts Utilized

### ✓ CRUD Operations
- CREATE: All INSERT statements
- READ: Verification queries
- UPDATE: Triggers handle automatic updates
- DELETE: CASCADE deletes configured

### ✓ Indexes
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for joins
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Full-text indexes for search

### ✓ Views
- See `03_views.sql` for materialized views
- User statistics view
- Club analytics view
- Event summary view

### ✓ Stored Procedures
- See `04_procedures.sql`
- Event registration procedure
- Points calculation procedure
- Badge awarding procedure

### ✓ Functions
- See `05_functions.sql`
- Calculate user rank function
- Get badge progress function
- Event capacity check function

### ✓ Triggers
- See `06_triggers.sql`
- Auto-update member counts
- Auto-award badges
- Audit log triggers
- Points calculation triggers

### ✓ ACID Properties
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency**: Foreign keys maintain referential integrity
- **Isolation**: InnoDB engine provides transaction isolation
- **Durability**: Data persists after commit

## Next Steps

1. **Run Additional Scripts** (optional):
   \`\`\`bash
   mysql -u root -p < 02_indexes.sql
   mysql -u root -p < 03_views.sql
   mysql -u root -p < 04_procedures.sql
   mysql -u root -p < 05_functions.sql
   mysql -u root -p < 06_triggers.sql
   \`\`\`

2. **Connect Frontend**: Update your `.env` file with database credentials

3. **Test Queries**: Run sample queries to ensure data is accessible

4. **Monitor Performance**: Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query performance

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Verify MySQL version compatibility
3. Ensure proper user privileges
4. Review the troubleshooting section above
